### Hi there, It's [Mo!](https://mohabouje.github.io) ðŸ‘‹

<br />
In every tech movie, thereâ€™s a crazy hacker that can do everything, right? Those poor reproductions are based on me!
<br />
<br />
I'am a geek enthusiast! I started coding when I got my first PC in 2006. I remember my first C code; it still makes my hair stand on end. Ever since that moment, I knew I was born to be an engineer. Nowadays, I hold a BSc & MSc in Telecommunications Engineer from the University of Granada, Spain.
<br />
<br />
If you are looking for someone passionate about technology with a strong background in algorithm design, optimizations, and digital signal processing, someone enthusiastic, responsible and wishing to develop his skill-set, you just found him!
<br />
<br />
I commonly understand and adapt myself to the local conditions and the working environment, independently but also effectively as part of a team. I love solving complex problems and working alongside talented people, as someone said, if youâ€™re the smartest person in the room, youâ€™re in the wrong place.
<br />
<br />
I am continuously trying to figure out the best practices and useful design patterns to develop robust, maintainable and scalable solutions. I am passionate about electronics and software engineering, and both are part of my daily hobbies.
<br />
<br />
I am an active open-source contributor. I have personally been involved very intimately in projects linked to cutting-edge technologies by designing robust algorithms related to generic fields like digital signal processing, positioning systems, big data analysis, and machine learning.
